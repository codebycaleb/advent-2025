# Advent of Code 2025

✨ In Gleam! ✨

## Notes

- Input .txt files go in a top-level `inputs` directory (.gitignore'd)
- I won't write anything in the `test` directory; this is for fun, not work
- I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to Gleam (or with Typing), so please don't judge bad code lol
- No promises that I do anything past day 1
